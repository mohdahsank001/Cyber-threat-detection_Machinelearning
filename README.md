# Cyber-threat-detection with Machinelearning and associated Models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project I have created a machine learning model to predict and analyse Cyber attacks and threats in a network by doing a comparative analysis among different classification algorithms including isolation forest - publication in progress.


Project Abstract : 
---------------------

Malicious insider attacks can be one of the most damaging threats to companies and government organizations. In today’s world we can see many sectors where security is of major concern, Healthcare is particularly an example of a sector where the duty to safeguard the patient data is of utmost importance. Not only the clients who in this case are the patients would request and call for providers to protect their privacy, there would exist even more stern and uncompromising rules and regularities that would govern the way the healthcare organizations would control security.

This project report would analyze the behavior of a net flow archive by the means of unsupervised machine learning methods which would enable us to find potential cyber-attacks in the form of botnet architecture.
In addition to it, a supervised learning model is trained and the adversarial samples are collected to evaluate if the model would be susceptible to an evasion attack. A cyber-attack is always imminent which might result in confidentiality breach from unauthorized access and misuse which might lead to a potential violation of security. In that case functional security measures will have to be setup to make certain that the personal data is always well protected.

Safeguard against unauthorized access by hackers would result in the manipulation of the data or would result in misuse of the user data leaking all of the confidential data hence compromising the user’s privacy. And this is also a very crucial factor to be adhered to.

A machine learning based Cyber-attack detection system would be able to learn from the limited ground truth and then detect new malicious insiders with a higher accuracy. In this project, I aim to develop a machine learning based threat detection system using python and associated libraries.

My project code submission would include The following folders and files : 

1. Pre-processing  - Consists of all the files that are related to pre-processing or noise removal, this includes Jupyter notebooks and output in csv files. 

Files that are related to  preprocessing of Task 1 dataset (Inside the folder A1 code): 

preprocessingA1-2.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for pre-processing or noise removal of the datasets related to task 1.  

preprocessingA1.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for further pre-processing or noise removal of the datasets related to task 1.  

preprocessing_A2.ipynb - for preprocessing all the data related to task 2. 

Other files are present inside respective folders. 


2. Feature selection - Consists of all the files that are related to Feature selection. 

Files that are related to feature selection. 

Inside the folder code , we have : 

feature_selection_with_PCA_A1.ipynb - for feature selection process via the PCA method. 

feature_selection_with_Variance_Treshold_A1.ipynb - for feature selection process via the Variance threshold method (VT). 

Feature selection was done through two different methods which are Variance threshold and PCA or principle component analysis. 

3. ML models - Consists of all the files that are related to model creation , with the processing and Results in Jupyter notebooks and csv files. 

Files that are related to modelling with the help of iForest classifier is present inside the folder iForest classifer.

Files that are related to modelling with the help of K Means classifier is present inside the folder KMeans.


Files that are related to modelling with the help of logistic classifier is present inside the folder Logistic regression and similarly for the output as well. 


4. Results - Consists of all the results in csv files and also the related jupyter notebooks. 

Results consists of 3 sub folders iForest, K Means and Logistic regression. The respective files and jupyter notebooks are present inside each of these folders. 

For each of the model the results are also present inside the jupyter notebook (with detailed analysis) and also the folder output would consist of all csv files with output for each of the model .

5. Output - Selected output for Task 1 and Task 2. For Task 1 I selected the output from the iForest  Classifier and for task 2 I have utilised logistic regression.
